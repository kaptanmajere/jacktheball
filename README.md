# Jack The Ball
Fast paced arcade game project for university (2020)

## Author's Note:

Jack the ball was a school project. It was developed in two weeks and contains a lot of bugs and missing features. It uses processing framework for java. I may return to it in a future date. 

### Gameplay

In JtB you control a yellow ball that can move around with arrow keys. Main goal is to get the highest point possible before you die. There are other ball types that can change the game's dynamic.

**Blue Ball:** Increases score based on a multiplier.

**Orange Ball:** Increases the radius of danger zone.

**Purple Ball:** Increases Jack's move speed.

**Green Ball:** Increases heatlh by 1.

**Danger Zone:** Decreases health by 1.

**Black Ball:** Instant gameover.

#### Controls 

Movement: Arrow Keys

Color change: "Q"

#### Cosmetics

After reaching certain score milestones background changes color. You can also change the balls color by pressing "Q".

#### Music

The music and sound effects used in the main project were lost. I replaced them with empty sound files. I might update sound files later. Suggestions are really appreciated üëç.
